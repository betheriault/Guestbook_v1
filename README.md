## Guestbook API Project

This is just a small guestbook API project using a minimal ASP.Net API format. 

I challeneged myself to build four projects this year, each lasting about 3 months. This is the first project and with everything seemingly being an API these days, I figured I should probably learn them and what better way than by building one, eh?
