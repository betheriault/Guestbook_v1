        <h2>Hey! Welcome to the <i>About Me</i> page!</h2>
        <p>
          it's nothing special, just a place to type some stuff about this website. It's just a project
          I'm putting together to try and understand setting up API shizz and maybe setting up a VPS, not
          too sure about that latter part yet, at least with this project; maybe someday!
          <br><br>
          Anywho, here are some more words about stuff. I could just do a 'Lorem Ipsum' thingy here but honestly
          I have the time to just write nonsense at the moment. It's late March and feels more like early April,
          don't you hate that? Cause this time of the year is just a drag: most of the snow has already melted
          so winter activities are out, but there's still just enough to make things inconvenient if you want to go
          try to do some summer activities.  I guess I could get seedlings started for the summer, I'm going to
          try and do a simple herb garden in a raised-bed I'll build from pallets. Just another little project to do,
          much like this here API project.
          <br><br>

          Well, I fell like I've been rambling for some time so I'm going to wrap it up. Thanks for checking out
          the <i>About Me</i> page, and more precisely thank you for checking out this little API Project website.
          It ain't much but it's a start!
        </p>
